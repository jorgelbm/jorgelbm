# Hey 👋
My name is Jorge Marques.  

I am a Computer Engineer student at UNIVASF. 👨‍💻

Since I started computer engineering at the university, I'm discovering a and trying to learn a lot of new things.

I worked with data science using python in a scientific project last year. Currently I'm studying Front-end development.

I like to listen a lot to music, playing online games and dungeons & dragons.  ✨

### At the moment, my goals are:
-  Learn more front-end frameworks. 📚 
- Start studying back-end. 📚
- Become a full-stack developer.  📚
